    <h2>A Brief History our National Parks</h2>

    <p>The National Parks were formed because of the revolutionary idea that came from the desire to preserve the nation's natural wonders for future generations.</p>

    <p>The concept of national parks originated in the mid-19th century. As this concept came into fruition, Americans began to realize the value of protecting the natural regions from exploitation. It was in 1864 when Congress granted Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias to California for preservation. This was the first time that a piece of land was set aside for <a href="#conservation">conservation.</a></p>

    <p>In 1872, Yellowstone National Park was created. This was a watershed moment as it was the first national park in the world. Significant conservationists such as John Muir strongly advocated for the wilderness to be preserved. His worked inspired others and led to Mount Rainier and Sequoia being established.</p>

    <p>In 1916, the National Park Service or NPS, was formed. Their job was to manage the parks while also ensuring they were open and accessible to the public.</p>

    <p>The NPS became instrumental in expanding the park system and standardizing conservation efforts across the country.</p>

    <p>Over the decades, the National Park System expanded to include not only natural landscapes but also historical sites, and battlefields.</p>

    <p>In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt reorganized and consolidated many federally protected areas under the NPS, significantly broadening its scope.</p>

    <p>In addition, the Wilderness Act of 1964 and the National Parks and Recreation Act of 1978 further implemented conservation and expanded protected areas.</p>
